Managing applications
=====================

In murano, each application, as well as the form of application data entry,
is defined by its package. The murano dashboard allows you to import and
manage packages as well as search, filter, and add applications from catalog
to environments.

This section provides detailed instructions on how to import application
packages into murano and then add applications to an environment and deploy
it. This section also shows you how to find component details, application
topology, and deployment logs.

Import an application package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways of importing an application package into
murano:

* :ref:`from a zip file <ui_zip>`
* :ref:`from murano applications repository <ui_repo>`
* :ref:`from bundles of applications <ui_bundles>`

.. _ui_zip:

From a zip file
---------------

Perform the following steps to import an application package from a
.zip file:

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Applications > Manage > Packages`.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Import Package` button on the top right of the
   page.

   .. image:: ../figures/import_package.png
      :alt: Packages page: Import Package 1
      :width: 630 px

#. From the :guilabel:`Package source` drop-down list
   choose :guilabel:`File`, then click :guilabel:`Browse` to select a
   .zip file you want to import, and then click :guilabel:`Next`.

   .. image:: ../figures/browse_zip_file.png
      :alt: Import Package dialog: zip file
      :width: 630 px

#. At this step, the package is already uploaded. Choose a category
   from the :guilabel:`Application Category` menu. You can select
   multiple categories while holding down the :kbd:`Ctrl` key. If
   necessary, verify and update the information about the package,
   then click the :guilabel:`Create` button.

   .. image:: ../figures/add_pkg_info.png
      :alt: Import Package dialog: Description
      :width: 630 px

.. note::
  Though specifying a category is optional, we recommend that you
  specify at least one. It helps to filter applications in the
  catalog.

| Green messages appear at the top right corner when the application
  is successfully uploaded. In case of a failure, you will see a red
  message with the problem description. For more information, please
  refer to the logs.


.. _ui_repo:

From a repository
-----------------

Perform the following steps to import an application package from
murano applications repository:

.. note::
  To import an application package from a repository, you need to
  know the full name of the package. For the packages names, go to
  http://apps.openstack.org/#tab=murano-apps and click on the desired
  package to see its full name.

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Applications > Manage > Packages`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Import Package` button on the top right of the
   page.

   .. image:: ../figures/import_package.png

   choose :guilabel:`Repository`, enter the package name, and then
   click :guilabel:`Next`. Note that you may also specify the version
   of the package.

   .. image:: ../figures/repository.png
      :alt: Import Package dialog: Repository
      :width: 630 px

#. At this step, the package is already uploaded. Choose a category
   from the :guilabel:`Application Category` menu. You can select
   multiple categories while holding down the :kbd:`Ctrl` key. If
   necessary, verify and update the information about the package,
   then click the :guilabel:`Create` button.

   .. image:: ../figures/add_pkg_info.png
      :alt: Import Package dialog: Description
      :width: 630 px

.. _ui_bundles:

From a bundle of applications
-----------------------------

Perform the following steps to import a bundle of applications:

.. note::
  To import an application bundle from a repository, you need
  to know the full name of the package bundle. To find it out, go
  to http://apps.openstack.org/#tab=murano-apps and click on the
  desired bundle to see its full name.

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Applications > Manage > Packages`.

   .. image:: ../figures/bundle_name.png
      :alt: Import Bundle dialog
      :width: 630 px

Search for an application in the catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have imported many applications and want to quickly find
a required one, you can filter them by category, tags and words that
the application name or description contains:

In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to :menuselection:`Applications > Catalog
> Browse`.

The page is divided into two sections:

* **Recent Activity** shows the most recently imported or deployed
  applications.

* The bottom section contains all the available applications sorted
  alphabetically.

To view all the applications of a specific category, select it from
the :guilabel:`App Category` drop-down list:

  .. image:: ../figures/app_category.png
     :alt: Applications page: App Category
     :width: 630 px

To filter applications by tags or words from the application name or
description, use the rightmost filter:

  .. image:: ../figures/app_filter.png
     :alt: Applications page: Filter
     :width: 630 px

.. note::

   Tags can be specified during the import of an application package.

For example, there is an application that has the word
*document-oriented* in description. Let's find it with the filter.
The following screenshot shows you the result.

Add an application to environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After uploading an application, the second step is to add it to an
environment. You can do this:

* :ref:`from environment details page <from_env>`
* :ref:`from applications catalog page <from_cat>`

.. _from_env:

From environment details page
-----------------------------

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Applications > Catalog > Environments`.

#. Find the environment you want to manage and click
   :guilabel:`Manage Components`, or simply click on the environment's
   name.

#. Procced with the :ref:`Drop Components here <drag_and_drop>` field
   or the :ref:`Add Component <add_component>` button.

.. _drag_and_drop:

**Use of Drop Components here field**

#. On the Environment Components page, drag and drop a desired
   application into the :guilabel:`Drop Components here` field under
   the :guilabel:`Application Components` section.

Deploy an environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure to add necessary applications to your environment, then deploy it
following one of the options below:

* Deploy an environment from the Environments page

  #. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to :menuselection:`Applications >
     Catalog > Environments`.

  #. Select :guilabel:`Deploy Environment` from the Actions drop-down list
     next to the environment you want to deploy.

     .. image:: ../figures/deploy_env_2.png
        :width: 630 px
        :alt: Environments page

     It may take some time for the environment to deploy. Wait for the status
     to change from `Deploying` to `Ready`. You cannot add applications to
     your environment during deployment.

* Deploy an environment from the Environment Components page

  #. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to :menuselection:`Applications >
     Catalog > Environments`.

  #. Click the name of the environment you want to deploy.

     It may take some time for the environment to deploy. You cannot add
     applications to your environment during deployment. Wait for the status
     to change from `Deploying` to `Ready`. You can check the status either on
     the Environments page or on the Environment Components page.

.. _component-details:

Browse component details
------------------------

You can browse component details to find the following information about
a component:

* Name
* ID
* Type
* Instance name (available only after deployment)
* Heat orchestration stack name (available only after deployment)

To browse a component details, perform the following steps:

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Applications > Catalog > Environments`.

#. Click the name of the required environment.

#. In the :guilabel:`Component List` section, click the name of the required
   component.

   The links redirect to corresponding horizon pages with the detailed
   information on instance and heat stack.

.. _application-topology:

Application topology
--------------------

Once you add an application to your environment, the application topology of
this environment becomes available in a separate tab. The topology represents
an elastic diagram showing the relationship between a component and the
infrastructure it runs on. To view the topology:

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Applications > Catalog > Environments`.

#. Click the name of the necessary environment.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Topology` tab.

The topology is helpful to visually display complex components, for example
Kubernetes. The red icons reflect errors during the deployment while the green
ones show success.
