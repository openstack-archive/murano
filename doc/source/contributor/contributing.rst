So You Want to Contribute...
============================
For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.
Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with Murano.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* IRC channel #murano at OFTC
* Mailing list (prefix subjects with ``[murano]`` for faster responses)

on, search for the 'low-hanging-fruit' tag.

`Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/murano>`_.

Getting Your Patch Merged

All changes proposed to the murano project require one or two +2 votes
from murano core reviewers before one of the core reviewers can approve
patch by giving ``Workflow +1`` vote.
