===============================
Welcome to Murano Documentation
===============================

**Murano** is an open source OpenStack project that combines an application
catalog with versatile tooling to simplify and accelerate packaging and
deployment. It can be used with almost any application and service in
OpenStack.

Murano project consists of several source code repositories:

* `murano`_ -- the main repository. It contains code for Murano API server,
  Murano engine and MuranoPL.
* `murano-agent`_ -- the agent that runs on guest VMs and executes the
  deployment plan.
* `murano-dashboard`_ -- Murano UI implemented as a plugin for the OpenStack
  Dashboard.
* `python-muranoclient`_ -- Client library and CLI client for Murano.

.. note::
   `Administrator Documentation`, `Contributor Documentation`, and `Appendix`
   are under development at the moment.
