MuranoPL Core Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some objects and actions can be used in several application deployments.
All common parts are grouped into MuranoPL libraries.
Murano core library is a set of classes needed in each deployment.
Class names from core library can be used in the application definitions.
This library is located under the `meta <https://opendev.org/openstack/murano/src/branch/master/meta/io.murano>`_
directory.

Classes included in the Murano core library are as follows:

**io.murano**

- :ref:`object`
- :ref:`application`
- :ref:`security-group-manager`
- :ref:`environment`
- :ref:`cloud-region`

**io.murano.resources**

- :ref:`instance`
- :ref:`network`

**io.murano.system**

- :ref:`logger`
- :ref:`status-reporter`


.. _object:

Class: Object
-------------

A parent class for all MuranoPL classes. It implements the ``initialize``,
``setAttr``, and ``getAttr`` methods defined in the pythonic part of the Object class.
All MuranoPL classes are implicitly inherited from this class.

   <https://opendev.org/openstack/murano/src/branch/master/meta/io.murano/Classes/resources/Instance.yaml>`_
   file.


.. _instance-resources:

Resources
+++++++++

Instance class uses the following resources:

**Agent-v2.template**
 Python Murano Agent template.

 .. note::

    This agent is supposed to be unified. Currently, only Linux-based
    machines are supported. Windows support will be added later.

**linux-init.sh**
 Python Murano Agent initialization script that sets up an agent with
 valid information containing an updated agent template.

**Agent-v1.template**
 Windows Murano Agent template.

**windows-init.sh**
 Windows Murano Agent initialization script.


.. _network:

Class: Network
--------------

The basic abstract class for all MuranoPL classes representing networks.

.. seealso::

   Source `Network.yaml
   <https://opendev.org/openstack/murano/src/branch/master/meta/io.murano/Classes/resources/Network.yaml>`_
   file.

.. _logger:

Class: Logger
-------------

Logging API is the part of core library since Liberty release. It was
introduced to improve debuggability of MuranoPL programs.

You can get a logger instance by calling a ``logger`` function which
is located in  ``io.murano.system`` namespace. The ``logger`` function takes
a logger name as the only parameter. It is a common recommendation to use full
class name as a logger name within that class. This convention avoids names
conflicts in logs and ensures a better logging subsystem configurability.

Logger class instantiation:

.. code-block:: yaml

    $log: logger('io.murano.apps.activeDirectory.ActiveDirectory')


.. list-table:: **Log levels prioritized in order of severity**
   :widths: 10 35
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Level
     - Description
   * - CRITICAL
     - Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application
       to abort.
   * - ERROR
     - Error events that might not prevent the application from running.
   * - WARNING
     - Events that are potentially harmful but will allow the application
       to continue running.
   * - INFO
     - Informational messages highlighting the progress of the application
       at the coarse-grained level.
   * - DEBUG
     - Detailed informational events that are useful when debugging an
       application.
   * - TRACE
     - Even more detailed informational events comparing to the DEBUG level.

There are several methods that fully correspond to the log levels you can use
for logging events. They are ``debug``, ``trace``, ``info``, ``warning``,
``error``, and ``critical``.

Logging example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  $log.info('print my info message {message}', message=>message)

Logging methods use the same format rules as the YAQL :command:`format`
function. Thus the line above is equal to the:

.. code-block:: yaml

   $log.info('print my info message {message}'.format(message=>message))

To print an exception stacktrace, use the :command:`exception` method.
This method uses the ERROR level:

.. code-block:: yaml

   Try:
     - Throw: exceptionName
       Message: exception message
   Catch:
   With: exceptionName
   As: e
   Do:
     - $log.exception($e, 'something bad happen "{message}"', message=>message)

.. note::
    You can configure the logging subsystem through the ``logging.conf`` file
    of the Murano Engine.

.. seealso::

  * Source `Logger.yaml
    <https://opendev.org/openstack/murano/src/branch/master/meta/io.murano/Classes/system/Logger.yaml>`_
    file.

  * `OpenStack networking logging
    configuration <https://docs.openstack.org/liberty/config-reference/content/networking-options-logging.html>`_.

.. _status-reporter:

Class: StatusReporter
---------------------

Provides feedback feature. To follow the deployment process in the UI, all status changes should be included
in the application configuration.

.. seealso::

   Source `StatusReporter.yaml
   <https://opendev.org/openstack/murano/src/branch/master/meta/io.murano/Classes/system/StatusReporter.yaml>`_
