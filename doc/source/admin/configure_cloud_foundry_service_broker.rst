Murano service broker for Cloud Foundry
=======================================

Service broker overview
-----------------------

Service broker is a new murano component which implements `Cloud Foundry
<https://www.cloudfoundry.org/>`_ Service Broker API.

This lets users build 'hybrid' infrastructures that are services like databases, message
queues, key/value stores, and so on. This services can be uploaded and deployed with
murano and made available to Cloud Foundry apps on demand. The result is lowered cost,
shorter timetables, and quicker access to required tools â€” developers can 'self serve'
by building any required service, then make it instantly available in Cloud Foundry.

Configure service broker
------------------------

Manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use local murano installation, you can configure and run murano service
broker in a few simple steps:

#. Change into the murano directory:

   .. code-block:: console

       cd ~/murano/murano

#. Generate the murano service broker config file.
   Murano service broker has a common config file for service broker API services.
   Using tox, generate a sample configuration file:

   .. code-block:: console

       tox -e gencfconfig

#. Copy the configuration file for further modifications:

   .. code-block:: console

       cd ~/murano/murano/etc/murano
       ln -s murano-cfapi.conf.sample murano-cfapi.conf

#. Edit ``murano-cfapi.conf``. Below is an example of the basic
   settings you may need to configure.

   .. note::

       The example below uses the SQLite database. Edit the **[database]**
       section to use another database.

   .. code-block:: ini

       [DEFAULT]
       debug = true
       verbose = true

       ...

       [database]
       backend = sqlalchemy
       connection = sqlite:///murano_cfapi.sqlite

       ...

       [keystone_authtoken]
       www_authenticate_uri = 'http://%OPENSTACK_HOST_IP%:5000/v3'
       auth_host = '%OPENSTACK_HOST_IP%'
       auth_port = 5000
       auth_protocol = http
       admin_tenant_name = %OPENSTACK_ADMIN_TENANT%
       admin_user = %OPENSTACK_ADMIN_USER%
       admin_password = %OPENSTACK_ADMIN_PASSWORD%

       ...

       [cfapi]
       tenant = %TENANT_NAME%
       bind_host = %HOST_IP%
       bind_port = 8083
       auth_url = 'http://%OPENSTACK_HOST_IP%:5000/v3'


   .. note::

       The ``bind_host`` IP should be in the same network as the
       Cloud Foundry instance.

#. Create database tables for murano service broker:

   .. code-block:: console

       cd ~/murano/murano
       tox -e venv -- murano-cfapi-db-manage \
         --config-file ./etc/murano/murano-cfapi.conf upgrade

#. Launch the murano service broker API in a separate terminal:

   .. code-block:: console

       cd ~/murano/murano
       tox -e venv -- murano-cfapi --config-file ./etc/murano/murano-cfapi.conf

   .. note::

       Run the command in a new terminal as the process will be running in
       the terminal until you terminate it, therefore, blocking the current
       terminal.

Devstack installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is really easy to enable service broker in your devstack installation.
You need simply update your ``local.conf`` with the following:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [[local|localrc]]
       enable_plugin murano https://opendev.org/openstack/murano
       enable_service murano-cfapi

How to use service broker
-------------------------

After service broker is configured and started you have nothing to do with service
broker from murano side - it is an adapter which is used by Cloud Foundry PaaS.

To access and use murano packages through Cloud Foundry, you need to perform following steps:

#. Log in to Cloud Foundry instance via ssh.

   .. code-block:: console

      ssh -i <key_name> <username>@<hostname>

#. Log in to Cloud Foundry itself.

   .. code-block:: console

      cf login -a https://api.<smthg>.xip.io -u <user_name> -p <password>

#. Add murano service broker.

   .. code-block:: console

      cf create-service-broker <broker_name> <OS_USERNAME> <OS_PASSWORD>  http://<service_broker_ip>:8083

#. Enable access to murano packages.

   .. code-block:: console

      cf enable-service-access <service_name>

   .. warning::

      By default, access to all services is prohibited.

   .. note::

      You can use ``service-access`` command to see human-readable list of packages.

#. Provision murano service through Cloud Foundry.

   .. code-block:: console

      cf create-service 'Apache HTTP Server' default MyApacheInstance  -c apache.json

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "instance": {
              "flavor": "m1.medium",
              "?": {
                  "type": "io.murano.resources.LinuxMuranoInstance"
              },
              "keyname": "nstarodubtsev",
              "assignFloatingIp": "True",
              "name": "<name_pattern>",
              "availabilityZone": "nova",
              "image": "1b9ff37e-dff3-4308-be08-9185705dad91"
          },
          "enablePHP": "True"
      }
