Murano
======

Murano Project introduces an application catalog, which allows application
developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready
applications in a browsable categorised catalog. Cloud users
-- including inexperienced ones -- can then use the catalog to
compose reliable application environments with the push of a button.
